# Personalized-Health-Insurance-Pricing
Machine Learning Project | Predicting Health Insurance Premiums
This project aims to predict personalized health insurance premiums based on customer health profiles. By analyzing risk factors such as age, BMI, smoking habits, and medical history, we built an optimized Gradient Boosting model to estimate premiums with high accuracy.
Dataset
The dataset contains demographic and health-related features of insurance customers.
Key attributes: Age, Gender, BMI, Smoking Status, Medical Conditions, Annual Premiums.
Technologies Used
* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn)
* Machine Learning (Gradient Boosting, Regression Models)
* Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* Model Evaluation (MSE, RMSE, R-Squared)
